#### 412c State review

The maximum credit for this element is 60 points. Under SR, a study receives additional credit when an independent quality assurance review, typically by a state agency as required by a state law, has been completed.

The types of reviews that qualify for SR credit include a review by a state or regional organization whose review program has been designated as qualifying for CRS credit. Note that the existence of an approved review program does not mean the community will automatically receive this credit. Each study credited must have been reviewed and approved by the review program, and the review must not be paid for by FEMA. There may be studies that were conducted before the program began and there may be some types of studies that the state or regional agency does not review.

To obtain credit if elevations are provided for a single site at the time of development, either each study must be reviewed and approved or the study technique must have been reviewed and approved.

There are three possible quality assurance/quality control reviews: hydrology, hydrauli cs, and mapping. As shown in the table below, the credit for a study that has passed all of these reviews is approximately 17% of the credit for a new study. If only part of the study process was reviewed (e.g., the state review only approves the hydrology), the credit for SR is prorated.
